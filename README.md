# Orbis

Orbis is a network inspector for iOS apps. 
It works by reporting the apps network activities to the Mac Client via the peertalk library.

This tool is in alpha quality and could use a lot of improvement. Contributions are very welcome.

The Mac client are stored here and it's built using react-native-desktop, and the app side are available in bukalapak_ios branch sprint_7 and above.
